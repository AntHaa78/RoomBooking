# RoomBooking

Inspired by the precedent Raspberry Pi teamproject (https://github.com/AntHaa78/Projekti) , this project aims to develop further the first mode (room booking) without the use of the Raspberry Pi and motion sensors.  To do so, we use the 'keyboard' library and simulate the trigger of a motion sensor by a keypress.

We will create dabases with the users info using sqlite3, and then display/modify them on the web using Flask. For now locally, later on GitHub pages.
